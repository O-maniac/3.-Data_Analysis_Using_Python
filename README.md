# 3.-Data_Analysis_Using_Python
Big_Mart Sales Analysis
In this analysis using Python Pandas & Seaborn to analyze and answer business questions for a big mart data.<br>
The data contains different product type broken down into Fat Content, outletsales, establishment type, weight, etc.<br>
On this journey I went from cleaning the data, to asking important Business Questions and then analysing the dataset to deduct essential Insights for Business Decisons making.<br>

The Process inludes:<br>
A.  DATA CLEANING.
In this stage, the tasks are:

1.  To Check for the NaN values
2.  To Drop NaN values from DataFrame
3.  To replace values with appriopriate valeues used in the exploratory analysis.<br>
  Once we have cleaned up our data a bit.<br>
 
B.  EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) 
In this section, important business questions related to the data were asked:

I.  Most Ordered Products inrespect to the Fat Content<br>
II. Show the Order by Product Type<br>
III.Count Against Establisment Year<br>
IV. How was the Outletsales by Fat Content?<br>
V.   What was the Outlet Sales by Establishment Year?<br>

In the quest of answering the above business questions I implore different pandas & matplotlib methods.<br>
They include:<br>
1.  Load the dataset<br>
2.  Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis<br>
3.  Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results<br>
4.  Labeling our graphs<br>
